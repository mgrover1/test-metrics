# Package Metrics
Below are some of the metrics related to activity on repositories that are
defined in the yml file and package downloads for repositories that are 
published packaged on PyPI or Conda Forge.  These metrics are updated periodically,
so check back later for new information.  (*Note that Conda download statistics can 
be months out of date, so it is likely that download numbers for the current and
last months will be inaccurate.*)
